Windows sucks!!!

Figure out how to address these things in Makefile

1.) Running make commands add flag -B. Thinks nothing needs to be built even when it does
2.) Running go server, and hitting ctrl-c does not kill process. Annoying because port is still bound.
Find port by running: netstat -ano | findstr 8080
Kill pid by running: tskill <pid>
